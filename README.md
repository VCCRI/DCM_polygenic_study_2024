A 2024 study on polygenic risk scores and familial inheritance of dilated cardiomyopathy

This repository contains the code for a 2024 study on the role of polygenic risk scores in the inheritance of dilated cardiomyopathy. Briefly, the methodology for this study identified odds ratios for disease outcomes using logistic mixed effects models, accounting for sample relatedness.

This study is currently under review as: Thompson JM, Johnson R, Troup M, Rath EM, Young PE, Soka MJ, Ohanian M, Tarr IS, Giannoulatou E, Fatkin D. Polygenic risk in families with dilated cardiomyopathy. (2024). Circulation Genomics and Precision Medicine.

Genomic data for this study were accessed through Australian Genomics, funded by the NHMRC (1113531, 2000001) and the MRFF, administered by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. The Australian Genomics Cardiovascular Disorders Flagship was funded by the MRFF Genomic Health Futures Mission (EPCD000028).
